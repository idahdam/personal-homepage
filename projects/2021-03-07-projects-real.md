Hello everybody!

<br/>

Finally, this a-month-or-so project is finally finished! I worked on this project for a month or so, trying to translate the UI to code using React and to deploy it, designed by my closest, Hamaswari. You can find her link on the footer section. In. Any. Page.

<br/>

 Wow, this project takes me back to my old, old, old, habit. Blogging. I used to blog alot. I was using this blogspot  by Google and wasn't happy with the pre-defined templates. I looked up for free template designs made by a lot of awesome and talented people, and that's where my exposure to this programming, especially web devleopment, began. 

<br/>

Using only HTML, simple Javascript, Adobe Dreamweaver, I made my dream blogging website. It was like 10 years ago. And now, here we are with the new look!\

Anyway, I love to write and make stupid things. Stupid is a relative term, in which I would **LOVE** to call myself stupid for wanting to learn more. Stay up-to-date with my content, especially I'm matured enough to determine what's right or wrong. 

<br/>

This project is not 100% finished. I will update this website whenever I want to and my taste is bad so please don't expect too much. If this project is working for a long time, I might even update my navbar with my portfolio. 

<br/>

If you like my work or anything that I do, you can contact me through one of my socials (hint hint, it's on the navbar). It's my 3rd time reading this, by the way, because netlifycms still got some bugs laying around on my plate. 

<br/>

Sincerely yours,

<br/>
