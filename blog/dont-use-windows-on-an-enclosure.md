During this 2020-2021 pandemic, I've had 4 different operating systems. Yeah, 4. All Windows.

<br />

I started using enclosure for my primary OS because I was too lazy to open up my laptop  and put the drive in. Until a few days ago. It was all started when I accidentally put my laptop on my bag too hard it hit the floor ( my bag was on the floor). After the class, I booted the thing and it showed no bootable media. The drive is corrupted. I was using HDD and eventually, you know, not great ending happened.

<br />

I went to the nearest computer repair shop asking how much should I pay to fix this because I pretty much had no time to fix this. The repair man told me it would cost around 700k. I said, "ah, no thanks". During the test of my device, he tested my laptop with a bootable media which has Windows inside of the USB drive. That made me think to have an OS inside of my Flashdrive for a while. The only problem is I only got an 8Gb of Flashdisk that time.

<br />

I looked up and found this amazing, superlight OS called [Slax](https://www.slax.org/). The size was roughly 500mb and you could run the OS entirely on your RAM. The only issue I encountered was obviously the capabilities. It was limited and I only able to use online application such as Google Docs, Spreadsheet, etc. 

<br />

Eventually, I bought an SSD with an enclosure. Didn't think It was a bad move, but it actually was. The interface of the USB would limit the speed of my SSD, wouldn't it? But as long as it worked, I didn't think too much of it.

<br />\
During the first month of pandemic, I had my first bluescreen using SSD with enclosure. Eventually it broke and I ended up using an SSD with an enclosure and forced to have a new OS. My 2nd OS after all. It only lasted for around 3 month before eventually broke again. I bought the HDD with pre-installed Windows in it using MBR. I think that was the reason why it broke? I ended up contacting my friend to hook me up with a fresh installation of Windows.

<br />

Around 3 months later, it happened again. I ended up using the 2017 build of Windows which is more stable but limited to some extent, such as availability to install Docker and stuff (even sharing screen on discord was limited to my Windows version). But I thought well it was okay as long as it works.

<br />

Few days ago, IT BROKE AGAIN. I was fuming. Eventually I throw the enclosure away, put the SSD I had fixed inside using the SATA3 interface and contacted my friend AGAIN for another Windows installation. I felt bad asking for installation of Windows 3 times in a row. I'm deeply sorry.
