I've had a chance to become one of the speakers in my department's event called \`Technoskill\`.

<br />

The event is related to Basic Python and Machine Learning, in which I had the opportunity to take part in the Basic Python section. It's a 3 days event, in which was finished by a competition using Kaggle. 

<br />

For the hands on experience, I was in charge for the first day, tutoring Basic Python for the event. It was fine but the event was held at 8 to 10 pm, a lot information to digest, and people do need coffee to stay focus during the session. It was fun.
